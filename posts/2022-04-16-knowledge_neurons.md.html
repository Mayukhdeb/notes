<h1 id="knowledge-neurons">Knowledge Neurons</h1>
<p>The knowledge neurons paper asks the following question:</p>
<p><em>Given an output <code>y</code> from an intermediate layer, how can we determine the neurons which contributed the most/least to the prediction ?</em></p>
<p>The neurons which contribute the most to the “fact” mentioned by the model are generally tagged as the “<em>knowledge neurons</em>”.</p>
<h2 id="procedure-to-find-knowledge-neurons">Procedure to find knowledge neurons</h2>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>Produce <code>n</code> different and diverse prompts expressing this fact</p></li>
<li><p>For each prompt, calculate the attribution score of each intermediate neurons</p></li>
<li><p>For each prompt, set an attribution score threshold <code>t</code> and retain only neurons with attribution scores greater than <code>t</code>, which are coarse knowledge neurons</p></li>
<li><p>We design our knowledge attribution method based on integrated gradients to evaluate the true contribution of each specific intermediate neuron in FFNs (Feed Forward Networks) to the final output.</p></li>
<li><p>Considering coarse knowledge neurons of all prompts, set a sharing percentage threshold and retain only neurons shared by more than prompts. The finally retained neurons are true knowledge neurons, where the fact is located.</p></li>
</ol>
<h2 id="drawbacks">Drawbacks:</h2>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>Generally this method <strong>does not work well with a single input prompt</strong>. It needs multiple sentences which have the same meaning but written differently in order to work effectively. Much like augmenting images in gradcam/IntegratedGradients to generate smoother heatmaps. One interesting way to possibly fix this issue would be to use something like NoiseGrad in the layers to get smoother outputs with a smaller amount of alt sentences.</p></li>
<li><p>Another drawback is the fact that is a <strong>localised explanation method</strong>, which can encapsulate only a small part of the model at a given instance. We can potentially find a way to find an extended “knowledge neuron map” which spans though multiple layers of the model.</p></li>
</ol>
<h2 id="other-interesting-facts">Other interesting facts:</h2>
<ul>
<li><p>Suppressing and amplifying knowledge neurons can control the expressions of the corresponding knowledge, without affecting other facts.</p></li>
<li><p>Such knowledge surgery in pretrained Transformers enables us to update incorrect knowledge, and to erase unethical knowledge.</p></li>
</ul>
<!-- # What can I try out ? 

- figure out how to implement knowledge neurons in gpt 2 colab -- maybe look into knowledge neurons eleuther source code ? 
- what happens if we use noisegrad along with integrated gradients while looking for knowledge neurons ? 
- how do knowledge neurons from one layer "talk to" the knowledge neurons in the next layer ?
- can we "see" knowledge being extracted and passed from one layer to another ?
- attribute knowledge neurons from layer i+1 to knowledge neurons of layer i.  -->
