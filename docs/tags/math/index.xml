      <description>I will first try to understand what a matrix is, and how it can be interpreted as a set of transforms that can be applied to a point in space. Then I&amp;rsquo;ll look at different types of matrices and what makes them unique. Finally, I&amp;rsquo;ll make an attempt at understanding the SVD on the next chapter.

      <description>I will first start with spectral decomposition and then move on to SVD.

 To truly understand this stuff, I&amp;rsquo;d have to first understand the following:
 Symmetric matrix Matrix Decomposition Eigen Vectors Orthogonal eigen vectors.  A symmetric matrix is where a[i,j] = a[j,i] where i !</description>
