<p>I will first try to understand what a matrix is, and how it can be interpreted as a set of transforms that can be applied to a point in space. Then I&rsquo;ll look at different types of matrices and what makes them unique. Finally, I&rsquo;ll make an attempt at understanding the SVD on the next chapter.</p>

<h1 id="what-is-a-matrix">What is a Matrix?</h1>
<p>I like to think of a matrix as a number box. It&rsquo;s like saying that a parrot is a green bird. Sure it tells me what it looks like, but it does not tell me what it does. Instead, one can think of a matrix as an operation that can be applied to a vector.</p>
<p><em>When you move a point from one position to another, is there a function that mathematically defines that movement?</em></p>
<h1 id="what-is-a-vector">What is a vector?</h1>
<p>A vector can be thought of as a point in N dimensional space. It can be represented by the co-ordinates of the point like <code>p = [1, 3, -4]</code> is a 3 dimensional vector such that it represents the point <code>x=1, y=3, z=-4</code> in 3D space.</p>
<h1 id="a-matrix-as-a-transform">A matrix as a transform</h1>
<p>We can multiply a matrix to a vector, and that gives us another vector. For a better intuition, we will be visualizing a set of points and what a single matrix (read: transform) does to it. In this case, the set of points would be a rectangle.</p>

<h1 id="types-of-matrices">Types of matrices</h1>
<h3 id="identity-matrix">Identity Matrix</h3>
<img src = 'https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/53133634/250339004-004e9aea-e1db-497b-9daf-4fc3972d7669.png' width = "50%">
<p>It&rsquo;s basically the do nothing transform. Kind of like multiplying something by 1 or adding 0 to it. Does nothing.</p>
<h3 id="scalar-matrix">Scalar Matrix</h3>
<p><em>Strech or squeeze uniformly along all axes.</em></p>
<img src = 'https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/53133634/250339140-c889f537-e2df-492d-81eb-b564830c42d4.png' width = "50%">


Now if \(k > 1\), then the rectangle gets bigger by a factor of \(k\). In a similar way, it also gets smaller if \(0 < k < 1\). Interestingly enough, the rectangle would flip both horizontally and vertically if \(k = -1\)

<img src = 'https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/53133634/250339333-f48e66a6-f255-402b-b6c9-a8f5a80f9616.png' width = "50%">

This is what happens when \(k = 2\), the rectangle just becomes 2x bigger.


<h3 id="off-one-matrix">Off-One Matrix</h3>
<p><em>Strech or squeeze along only one axis.</em></p>
<img src = 'https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/53133634/250339721-f66259fd-3a21-4216-b175-f2ff03faa2ff.png' width = "50%">
<p>Notice how only one of the diagonal elements are not 1. That is the axis along which we&rsquo;ll scale the vectors. Given below is an example of a where we strech the y axis by a factor of 3.</p>
<img src = 'https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/53133634/250339989-7c0f28e6-0a59-467b-8780-43e3511a2a10.png' width = "50%">
<p>If we scale only one axis by a factor of -1, then we basically get the reflection of that object along the corresponding axis.</p>
<h2 id="diagonal-matrix">Diagonal Matrix</h2>
<p><em>Strech or squeeze differently on different axes</em></p>
<img src = 'https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/53133634/250340152-bbe55aab-bb37-4762-bb05-a5779f8e86fc.png' width = "50%">
<p>Every diagonal matrix can be broken down into a series of off-one matrices. Given below is an example where we break down a single diagonal matrix (to the left) into a series of matrices which when sequentially applied would give us the same result.</p>

<h2 id="shear-matrix">Shear Matrix</h2>
<p><em>Slant along one or more axes</em></p>
<img src = 'https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/53133634/250340769-29e8abbc-c04b-4491-8746-719f4a77c4da.png' width = "50%">
<p>For example, a rectangle would slant into a parallelogram.</p>
<p>In 2D, there are 4 directions in which we can apply the shear transform. You can see them below.</p>
