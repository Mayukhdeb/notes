The great questions in any field are the ones which an intelligent child asks and then stops asking once he's unable to find the answers.

4 questions that an intelligent child asks:

- what goes on when we perceive?
- what goes on when we move?
- what goes on when we feel emotions?
- what goes on when we learn or remember?

Psychology and Cognitive science is a field where we try to **explain, predict and control** the behaviour of humans. This field has the potential to do more harm than physics has managed to.

The questions of perception, movement, emotions and learning are all intertwined. For example, let's take the one of the simplest possible question in perception:

*How do I see a single line as a line?*
*Why does the line stay vertical when I tilt my head?*
*Why does the line not move when I move?*

As you might've observed, when we try to deal with the problem of perception, the unanswered questions about movement start coming in.

*How do we move relative to the objects we're looking at?*

The following is a conversation between a doctor and a patient suffering from eye paralysis:

**Doctor**: *How do you know something is amiss?*
**Patient**: *Every time I want to move my eyes the world jumps.*

Note how the person never says that his eyes are paralysed. You cannot dissociate the problem of perception from the problem of movement.

We have maps of the world that transcend what's immediately given to thes senses. How is that done?

The first step in any new field is to know what to be astonished at.
