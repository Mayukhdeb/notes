Electric current is the flow of charged particles across space. There's a lot of electric current flowing the human brain at any given moment. This can be measured. 

A moving charged particle creates a magnetic field in the space surrounding it. Hence in order to detect the movement of charged particles, we can set up a magnetic "mic" somewhere around the area which would pick up the magnetic fields caused by the moving.
